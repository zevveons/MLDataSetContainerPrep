# MLDataSetContainerPrep
 🐦‍⬛  tweet and entity data from a file, rebuilds their text from word indices, and sets up empty dictionaries to later store labels, groupings, and other information for evaluation.  🐦‍⬛ 


What does it do/Prove?

✅ Data Loading – Shows ability to load complex data structures (like tokenized text) from external files using pickle.

✅ Reverse Dictionary Mapping – Demonstrates skill in reconstructing mappings (e.g., idx2word) to convert indices back into readable text.

✅ Data Reconstruction – Rebuilds full tweet and entity texts from token indices, useful for NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks.

✅ Initialization of Data Structures – Prepares a variety of empty dictionaries to organize labels, groupings, and relationships, showing foresight in data management.

✅ Separation of Concerns – Sets up clear mappings for different kinds of relationships (tweets → entities, entities → groups, roles → frames), reflecting organized thinking.

✅ Code Readability and Maintainability – Clean and modular design, making it easy for other developers to understand and extend.

✅ Handling External Data Sources – Shows ability to integrate pre-processed data into a new workflow or model evaluation setup.

✅ Understanding of NLP and ML Pipelines – Implies familiarity with common tasks like token handling, label management, and evaluation preparation.

✅ Use of Standard Libraries – Uses industry-standard libraries like pickle, os, matplotlib, numpy, and graphviz, indicating good foundational knowledge.

✅ Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Encapsulates functionality within a Python class, demonstrating understanding of OOP principles.
